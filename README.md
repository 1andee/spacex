## spacex-app

Searchable list of rocket launches using [SpaceX Rest API V2](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/) ðŸš€

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### functional requirements

Make a small React application that:
 - makes http calls to a public api (for example: https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/search.json?q=cat&restrict_sr=1)
 - have some text inputs for users to customize the call to the api, with very basic input validation
 - display the results from the api in a list view
 - click on a result to see a details view with more information
 - basic styling, maybe some animation


### recommendations
 - if you get stuck, leave a comment about how you figured out the problem, or how you intend to figure it out if you had more time
 - try to cover any edge cases or potential performance problems if you come across them
 - use create-react-app and publish the finished code to github  
 - use netlify to host your application
